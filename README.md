# Hoverboard

If deployed: https://thedanitor.github.io/hoverboard/

This project is from the Day 36 code along video from Udemy's 50 projects in 50 days series focused on web development. I have added some comments to the CSS and JavaScript to make notes to myself why certain choices are being made and what particular lines of code do.

### Overall Impression

For this project we made a grid of squares that change color as you hover over them. It was a cool visual effect that was, once again, simpler than I initially thought. This could be useful starter code for some kind of game or drawing app.
